Since we have ten different people, we know that one person's space can be numbered as total_of_colors%10 assuming we assign each person a numerical value (0-9)
Only one person meets the criteria of the actual total and they always will so we can use that to always know the color of their hat. Letâ€™s also number our different hats (0-9) so we can calculate a total value based on the hats present. In this scenario, we can say that total_we_can_see+on_our_head=total_total. If we assume we are always the spot where the total%10==position and we also recognize that the total has to be <= what_we_see+9,
we can add 9 to what_we_see to get possible_total and subtract one until possible_total%10=space. This possible total will be the total that works
for this space assuming the condition that we are at the space that is equal to the total%10.
Now we can check if possible_total-what_we_see==color on head and this will be true for exactly one person. Everyone will pass the class and it will always be the person in the space==total%10
